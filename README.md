## Text Classifier using Markov Model
* The **Markov Model** is used to model sequences. In NLP, the sequences can be of **Categorical Symbols** which are referred to as **States.**<So, the Markov Model is all about modeling sequences where each state depends on the previous state we came from (Markov Property). For that, we create the **State Transition Matrix(A)** and the **Initial State Vector(pie)**.<br/>
* Using the Markov model(A and pie) we can answer interesting questions like:-<br/>1) What is the probability of a particular sequence.<br/>2)Given the dataset, can we determine A and pie(**Training**)<br/>
